This repository contains list of pet projects. The goal is to learn/train to apply data science skills.

Projects are following: 
1. Decition tree and daya exploration with titanic dataset \
Expolre and preprocess dataset, implement decision tree model with metrics
2. Gridsearch for decition tree with titanic dataset \
Use gridsearch to estimate better values for hyperparameters. Use mlflow to log best experiments. Use pipelines to compare different preprocess steps.
